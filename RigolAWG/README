Code for interfacing with a Rigol DG4162 AWG (and similar models)

The Rigol DG4162 is a two channel function generator featuring both USB TMC and TCPIP interfaces.
This Labscript interface is designed to program the function generator before a sequence runs.
Each channel is then independently triggerable.

The labscript_device currently only implements fixed frequencies and linear sweeps,
but the blacs_tab and blacs_worker support more features, so adding more complex outputs is easy.

See `example_sequence.py` for an example of device use.
The two channels are created as child devices,
with a channel automatically created when a trigger is supplied.
Without a trigger, the channel will not be created, so even for purely static channels,
a dummy trigger is required.
