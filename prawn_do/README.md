Code for interfacing with a Raspberry Pi Pico used as a basic digital output.
See (TODO: insert link) for the Pi Pico code.

PrawnDO is a cheap, reasonably high performance way to have 16 buffered (in the sequence sense) digital outputs.
Preliminary tests have indicated accurate timing to +/-10ns (given by the PIO clock frequency, which is 10MHz).
